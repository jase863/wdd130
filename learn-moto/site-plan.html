      <h2>
        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Why come to the site?</h4>
People will come to my site to learn more about motorcycles. Most likely, they will be people who are interested in starting to ride, but they may also be people who are
just interested in motorcycles in general, or who are scared of motorcycles. The site will be geared towards all levels of motorcycle enthusiasts, from the unenthused to
the over enthused, so that no matter who visits the site, they are sure to gain some knowledge. Even people who have been riding for most of their lives may be able to 
gain some insight into riding styles that differ from their own.
        <h4>What answers can be found on the site?</h4>
Visitors to the site may be looking for answers as to what different motorcycles are used for, which kind would be best for their needs, or what kind of gear they would
need to protect themselves from injury. They may also expect to learn about the different riding styles, both on and off road. They have almost definitely seen multiple 
different types of motorcycles in their lives, and they may wonder why there are so many.
        <h4>Why choose this site over others?</h4>
There are many different motorcycle sites out there with a lot of information. Although the information on my site will be far from a comprehensive guide to motorcycles,
visitors will at least be able to get most of the information they need in one place, rather than having to visit a lot of different websites to find what they’re looking
for. This will save them time in the long run. From there, they can search the internet for more information if they would like to learn more in depth things about a 
certain type of motorcycle.
        <h4>Motorcycle types</h4>
One of my plans is to have a main page with pictures of a multitude of different motorcycles. I plan on having the visitor hover over the different pictures, at which point they will be shown 
information about that type of motorcycle and be able to learn about it. Although they won't learn everything there is to know about every type of motorcycle, they will 
leave the site with more knowledge than they had before.

      </ul>
      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Safety gear</h4>
I plan to have another page that is devoted to motorcycle gear. Motorcycles can be dangerous, but the level of danger is significantly reduced when the proper gear is 
worn by the rider. This includes helmets, knee pads, elbow pads, chest protectors or rock deflectors, boots, armored jackets, and proper gloves. There are even some newer 
technologies such as pads that use the technology of non-Newtonian fluids, as well as airbag modules that the rider wears.
        <h4>Types and variants of safety gear</h4>
Similar to the page that I will make for the different types of motorcycles, I will have pictures of the different types of gear. I may also include a few different 
brand names with personal suggestions as to what may be the best for riders at different skill levels. As well as including the different types of gear, I may include 
different styles of the pieces of gear, for instance, some helmets cover the full face, while others only protect the top of the head. Each one has its own advantages 
and disadvantages, which I would like to discuss briefly.

      </ul>
      <h3>Riding Basics</h3>
      <p>
        <h4>Basic riding, safety, and social practices</h4>
My second page will be devoted to the basics of riding motorcycles, including some common safety practices. When starting to ride, it’s important to learn at a bare 
minimum the basics of riding rather than just trying to ride with no knowledge. There are some common social practices and safety practices whether you’re riding on the 
road or off the road. Even if the visitor to the site knows the mechanics of riding a motorcycle, they may not know these practices. I would like to introduce the basics
of those as well, since they may very well save someone’s life.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Create three wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them here</p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        The part underneath the title will have a few different pictures of motorcycles to scroll through. As the visitor hovers over the pictures
        under the "Motorcycle Types" section, they will either increase in size or display a bigger box with information.
