                    Why wear gear?
                </h2>
                <p class="paragraph">
                    The experience of riding motorcycles is an incredible one, but it can also come with some incredible risks, such as bad
                    weather, distracted drivers around the rider, and obstacles in the riding path. However, if the proper gear is worn, the 
                    chances of serious injury or death aren't nearly as high. On the road, gear is often used to prevent road rash, getting 
                    debris from the road embedded into your arm, and possibly even broken bones. When riding off-road, gear is often used for 
                    those purposes, but also to deflect rocks, protect your knees and elbows, and protect your lower legs. Similar to 
                    motorcycles,there are many different types and styles of gear. Depending on your desired styles, you might choose to wear 
                    leather gear, while someone else might choose to use Kevlar. No matter what kind you decide to use personally, it's always
                    a good idea to use safety gear.

                        Modular helmets are similar to full-face helmets. However, they allow the front to
                        come up, creating a 3/4 helmet.

                        Off-road helmets cover the full face. They have a chin bar that comes farther out,
                        allowing for more air flow to cool the rider down. They also have a visor to shield
                        from the sun. Goggles are typically not attached, so they are purchased separately.

                        Gauntlet gloves cover your hands and wrists to provide the most protection. They also

                        are made of leather, so they get hot.

                        typically have hard knuckles. They're often made of fabric mesh and leather, 
                        making them better ventilated. They are better for summer riding.

                        first knuckle.
