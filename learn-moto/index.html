                    Riding motorcycles is an exhilerating experience like no other. From the feeling of leaning your bike down into a turn, to the sight of
                    trees rushing past you on a forest trail, every ride seems to contain some new magic. That's why we made Learn Moto; because we believe
                    that everyone deserves to have those experiences. Whether you've been riding for decades, 
                    or you've only heard of motorcycles, we think you'll learn something new!

                    <p class="paragraph">
                        Many people are interested in learning more about motorcycles. Some people are interested in learning to ride, while others
                        want to learn about safety concerns. We're here to teach those people the things that they want to learn. There are a lot of
                        other motorcycle sites out there, and they've got a lot of information to digest. Our site is far from comprehensive, but it
                        will give people most of the important information without having to search as much. Our purpose is to make learning about
                        motorcycles a little easier. Whether you want to learn about a style that you're not familiar with, or there's a term
                        that you don't understand, we hope that we can teach you something!

                        Sport bikes, also known as "bullet bikes", are often used for racing, but are also a popular option for street riders. The 
                        street-legal varieties have blinkers, lights, spedometers, license plates, and other additions. The aggressive riding stance 
                        provides plenty of maneuverability. Riders of sport bikes also enjoy a high amount of accelaration and speed. The Honda CBR
                        series and Kawasaki Ninja are popular sport bikes.

                        Cruisers are some of the most popular street-legal motorcycles. They're characterized by footpegs that are positioned farther in
                        front of the rider, higher handlebars, and a relaxed riding stance. Since they are comfortable to ride, they are a more popular
                        option for longer distance rides. They're used widely by biker gangs, but also by average people. Bikes like the Harley Davidson
                        Softtail pictured above are popular cruisers.

                        Touring bikes are very similar to cruisers, but their larger engine size and comfort features make them ideal for long-distance
                        trips, such as cross-country rides. Features often include padded seats, large rear seats with arm rests, sound systems, cruise
                        control, and compartments for luggage, among other things. The most popular touring bike is the Honda Goldwing.

                        Adventure bikes are similar to dual sport bikes, which we'll discuss in the off-road section. They are best for riding on the 
                        road, but they can also be taken on dirt roads, grass, and many other terrains. They have an upright riding stance, making 
                        them considerably more comfortable than sport bikes. They also often include luggage options. The Honda Africa Twin pictured 
                        above is a popular choice among adventure bikes.

                        Trikes are a good option for a variety of different people. They provide stability so you don't need balance to ride, as well
                        as the ability to ride without needing strength in your legs. They provide more comfort on long trips, while still allowing you
                        to enjoy riding a motorcycle. They also have excellent storage space because of their bigger frame. The Harley Davidson Trike and
                        Can-Am Spyder (pictured in the slideshow) are popular three-wheeled motorcycles.

                        Choppers are unique motorcycles in every sense of the word. They are custom-made bikes that often use parts from other bikes.
                        They are often made from scratch, but can also be made by modifying an existing motorcycle. Although they can be made to 
                        almost any specification, they are traditionally very skinny, with long front forks.

                    Dirt bikes are motorcycles that are geared towards off-road use. They have different suspension from street bikes, which allows
                    them to not only go over rough terrain, but also have a softer landing when the rider goes off of a jump. Dirt bike engines are
                    smaller than street bike engines, but they are geared to give them plenty of power when it's needed.

                    <p class="type-paragraph">
                    Similar to adventure bikes, dual sport bikes can be riddent both on- and off-road. However, they are geared more towards 
                    off-road use. They are essentially dirt bikes with lights, blinkers, a spedometer, and other features that make them
                    street-legal.

                    <p class="type-paragraph">
                    Racing dirt bikes are often referred to as "MX" or "motocross" bikes. They are very similar to regular dirt bikes, but they are
                    tuned very differently. Their suspension is adjusted for the specific rider, and their engines are tuned to be very reactive.
                    The diffrences are similar to that of a regular car and a racecar. Typically, a rider is sponsored, so you will see company
                    logos on the sides of the bike.
