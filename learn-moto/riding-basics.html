                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty 
                Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 
                84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River, Utah) and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting 
                geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.
                </p>
                <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>
                <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that
                the canyon tells.</p>

                <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to make one truly unforgettable river 
                experience. The canyon is filled not only with exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins 
                accessible only by river.</p>
                <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10)
                to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
                rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
